ToneWand
========
Through a convoluted process, maps IMU input to tone generation.

Currently, 2 octaves are mapped, starting at A220. 
The magnetic bearing determines the tone frequency, and the (spatial) pitch determines octave. A tone is played when roll speed is greater than a threshold value - a wrist flick.
